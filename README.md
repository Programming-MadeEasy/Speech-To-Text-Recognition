# Speech-To-Text-Recognition
This repository contains a Jupyer notebook,[The Full Code.ipynb](https://github.com/Programming-MadeEasy/Speech-To-Text-Recognition/blob/main/The%20Full%20code.ipynb) that provides an easy programming code to convert any audio file recorded from your microphone to the written text.


## Modules/Libraries Used
1. sounddevice
2. wavio
3. winsound
