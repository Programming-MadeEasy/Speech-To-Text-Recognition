# Speech-To-Text-Recognition
This repository contains a Jupyer notebook,[The Full Code.ipynb](https://github.com/Programming-MadeEasy/Speech-To-Text-Recognition/blob/main/The%20Full%20code.ipynb) that provides an easy programming code to convert any audio file recorded from your microphone to the written text.

## The code can be analysed into three steps:-
1. Recording and saving audio file from the microphone
2. Playing the recorded audio file
3. Analysing the file and writing the text

## Modules used:-
1. Sounddevice and Wavio (microphone)
2. winsound (playing audio)
3. AssemblyAI (speech recognition)
